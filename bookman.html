So who looks after your kids since you don't have a man in your life?

What is your job all about?

That is a nice job,when will you retire?

Ok i will retire this year,am getting old not younger anymore.

Why you choose to remain single without a man?

tHAT 

Most woman this days are not faithful i mean the young ones who don't know more about a marriage life.

I am really searching for a matured and honest lady who will be my wife and a mother to my Kids.

What about you,what kind of a man will you love to meet?

It's will be easy to fine women who are honest and caring this days because most men are searching for the perfect woman to marry,but in the other hand i am searching for the imperfect woman to love and care for perfectly.

Are you a jealous woman?

Same here.

Am filled of jeolousy,i will not love to see my wife hangind around with another man,people do say jealousy deos not matter in a relationship,but i see it to as my first point,because it makes me secure my family.
